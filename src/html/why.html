                <div class="why__item-description">
                    <p>It is proven that <strong> JavaScript is the most popular technology in the software
                        engineering </strong> world.
                        JavaScript takes a leading spot in usage, popularity, and discussions.</p>
                    <p>UAccording to Stack Overflow Developer Survey (https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology),
                        JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. Stack Overflow says that 69.8
                        percent of its <strong>78,334 developers-respondents use JavaScript</strong> . Another Stack
                        Overflow’s Annual
                        Survey indicates that for the sixth consecutive year, JavaScript was named the most commonly
                        used programming language.</p>
                    <p>GitHub, a repository used by millions of developers, publishes yearly analytics about how things
                        have been going on in the previous year on their platform. A great number of GitHub users are
                        actually JavaScript developers. According to GitHub Octoverse 2022, <strong> JavaScript was
                            touted as the
                            most popular language </strong> based on the amount of opened pull requests.</p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, JavaScript-based technologies such as AngularJS, Node.js, and React also top the
                        list of commonly used frameworks, libraries, and tools.

                <div class="why__item-description">
                    <p>Web Technology Surveys (Web3Techs) reported that in 2022, <strong> JavaScript was used by 98
                        percent of
                        websites </strong> and topped the list of the highly popular client-side coding language.</p>
                    <p>
                        In web development, JavaScript has maintained dominance. Since 2009 when Node.js was released,
                        the scenario of ‘JavaScript everywhere’ was seen as a reality. The server-side framework based
                        on JavaScript language allows developers to <strong> unite web app development in a single
                        coding
                        language </strong> instead of relying on numerous languages to write the server-side code. The
                        package
                        manager of Node.js offers the biggest ecosystem comprising open-source libraries globally.

                    <p>
                        Another reason why JavaScript is popular and was chosen for AGORA is because of the support it
                        has. Many businesses would want to use the language because it has been utilized by large
                        companies. The language has been <strong> implemented by major companies such as Alibaba,
                        Google,
                        Microsoft, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Companies like Netflix, GoDaddy, Slack, Yahoo, and
                        PayPal </strong>
                        have written their web apps entirely in JavaScript. HubSpot, Adblock Plus, Mozilla, Lightshot,
                        and Greasemonkey make some of the desktop apps that have been built in JavaScript. Facebook has
                        been backing the use of JavaScript all along, whereas LinkedIn changed its server-side to
                        Node.js. PayPal also moved from Java to JavaScript. Being used by such big tech companies
                        contributes to its popularity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason why tech giants are using JavaScript is because it can handle as well as solve a
                        majority of their tasks. <strong> The programming language is powered by libraries and popular
                        frameworks
                        is has </strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is platform-independent. Any JavaScript-enabled browser, which most browsers are, can
                        easily understand and interpret JavaScript code.
