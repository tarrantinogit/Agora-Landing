                    <p>The application supports the main OGS (Open Geospatial Consortium) services. It allows users to
                        work with a <strong>wide range of raster and vector data</strong>. The required data can be presented in a
                        variety of formats, including <strong>GeoTIFF, GeoJSON, Shapefiles, and CSV with JPEG, PNG, and PDF </strong>
                        options for images. The user is given the opportunity to fill the catalog by downloading the
                        necessary files or connecting documents from remote resources using an external link to the
                        required source. All loaded layers and maps store their own metadata, including the projection
                        used. The advanced features of the document library allow to accompany the metadata of a map or
                        layer with additional necessary attributes, as well as manage related documents.</p>
                    <p>Users can easily view existing maps and create their own maps based on downloaded or connected
                        layers.</p>
                    <p><strong> An important feature is an ability to provide information to external information systems</strong>. For
                        them, GeoCMS implements link access to their storage data. This simple method allows other
                        systems to obtain up-to-date published GeoCMS data and use it as a source of additional
                        information.</p>
