				<strong>AGORA is a multi-component content services platform</strong> designed to
				implement enterprise solutions of any complexity and developed on the basis of a
				number of open-source platforms, libraries, and applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				When designing solutions on the AGORA platform, modern approaches are taken into
				account for the implementation of corporate applications of any difficulty and
				ensuring increased requirements for their
				<strong>productivity, fault tolerance, and scaling.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The architecture of each solution is designed on the basis of the general scheme of
				AGORA components and consists of elements that are necessary to meet the needs of
				the organization. This approach ensures the most
				<strong>efficient use of the organization's resources</strong> during the operation
				of the developed solution.
			</p>
			<h6 class="architecture__content-title">General Scheme of Components:</h6>
			<p>
				Each AGORA component has its own architecture and approach to its implementation.
				All of them are united by the main component â€“ the UnityBase module, which is
				responsible for the fast intercomponent interaction of the solution.
