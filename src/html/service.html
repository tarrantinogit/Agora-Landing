                <div class="service__item-description">
                    <p>When users are located and managed directly in the platform itself – A single sign-on is
                        implemented,
                        ensuring <strong> simultaneous login of platform users</strong> to different components of the
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>When users are separate from the platform – The ability to register and manage new users that are
                        completely separated from the platform with their own roles, rights, and personal information is
                        implemented. For example, this option is used to <strong> manage users of web portals that are managed
                        through AGORA CMS.</strong></p>
